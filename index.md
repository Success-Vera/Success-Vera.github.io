### About Me

My name is Ifeoma Veronica Nwabufo. I am currently a student at the [African Masters of Machine Intelligence](https://aimsammi.org/) (AMMI) programme, working towards an Msc in Machine Intelligence sponsored by Facebook and Google. I also did an MSc in Mathematical Sciences at the [African Institute for Mathematical Sciences](https://aims-senegal.org/) (AIMS) in 2020 where I got exposed to the use of computational tools for analysis. I researched on computational learning theory for my MSc thesis and was supervised by Prof. Rehana Patel. Specifically, my MSc project was on "A Combinatorial Characterisation of PAC-Learnability" where I explored a type of learning framework called Probably Approximately Correct Learning. My undergraduate studies was at [Kaduna State University](https://kasu.edu.ng) (KASU), where I researched on "The Transmission Dynamics of Lassa Fever with Control" under the supervision of Dr. Patrick Noah Okolo.
