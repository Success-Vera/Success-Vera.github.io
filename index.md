### About Me

My name is Ifeoma Veronica Nwabufo. I enjoy writing short stories, talking on events and playing table tennis. Learning is a lifestyle for me. My curious nature makes me learn from books, videos and people. You'd often find me interacting with people as I try to relearn, unlearn and learn. 


I am currently a Research Fellow with Berens Lab at the Hertie Institute for AI in Brain Health in Tübingen, Germany funded by the Cluster of Excellence - Machine Learning for New Perspectives in Science, University of Tübingen. My project is on the visualization of medical images. Specifically, I am using the [t-SimCNE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09879) method. I have also written a [blog](https://ifysuccessvera.medium.com/unsupervised-visualization-of-images-using-t-simcne-23a9ad15f0) on this method which you might want to see.

I was a student in the [African Masters of Machine Intelligence](https://aimsammi.org/) (AMMI) programme where I studied for an Msc in Machine Intelligence sponsored by Facebook and Google. I also did an MSc in Mathematical Sciences at the [African Institute for Mathematical Sciences](https://aims-senegal.org/) (AIMS) in 2020 where I got exposed to the use of computational tools for analysis. I researched on computational learning theory for my MSc thesis and was supervised by Prof. Rehana Patel. Specifically, my MSc project was on "A Combinatorial Characterisation of PAC-Learnability" where I explored a type of learning framework called Probably Approximately Correct Learning. My undergraduate studies was at [Kaduna State University](https://kasu.edu.ng) (KASU), where I researched on "The Transmission Dynamics of Lassa Fever with Control" under the supervision of Dr. Patrick Noah Okolo.
